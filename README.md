# USE THE NEWER AND BETTER VERSION OF THIS : https://github.com/femvoi/pg-disabler


# patchedguard

shitty runtime patchguard(kpp) disabler

it only work's for 22h2 as tested and as it uses offsets for most of the project.

tested using kdmapper with good results. 

to check if its working i hooked KeBugCheckEx and had got no bluescreen for around 1 hour on my vm with Kernel Debugging Disabled.

not stable or production ready.
